## HAYO!!

My name is Sangyun Kim.

Currently a college student studying computer science ðŸ˜„

Mostly interested in AI, especially regarding games, since I love games! (Especially card games, like MTG!)

I'm still learning... but I believe I become great in the future.

So, keep your eyes on me! I'll try hard ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

### ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning these!
- Algorithm (Expected: ~2025.1)
- Fluent Python (Expected: ~2025.2)

### ðŸŒ± My Roadmap
- PyTorch (Expected: 2025.2)
- JAVA (Expected: 2025.3~5)
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (Expected: 2025.3~5)
- Korean Public Service (Expected: 2025.4~2026.12)
- Focus on studying for the Patent Attorney Exam (Expected: 2025.5~2026.7)

### ðŸ”­ I worked on this!
- MTG Arena Namuwiki (Private: a little embarassing to show this messy code to you... maybe i will refine and republish it later)

### ðŸ¤” I'm going to work on this!
- [kplers MTG Project](https://github.com/kplers/kplers-MTGA-Project)

This is going to be a large project and will take a lot of time and learning. Currently no exact schedules. Likely to be after the Patent Attorney Exam (2026.8~)
