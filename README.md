## HAYO!!

My name is Sangyun Kim.

Currently a college student studying computer science ðŸ˜„

Mostly interested in AI, especially regarding games, since I love games! (Especially card games, like MTG!)

I'm still learning... but I believe I become great in the future.

So, keep your eyes on me! I'll try hard ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

### ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning these!
- Algorithm (Expected: ~2024.12)
- React (Expected: ~2025.2)
- Pytorch / Deep Learning (Expected: ~2025.1)

### ðŸŒ± I'm also learning these!!
- Japanese (Expected: Forever..?)
- Civil Law (Expected: ~2026.11, I'm slowly preparing for the exam for Patent Attorney in 2026.11)

### ðŸŒ± I want to learn these...

- More on Deep Learning...     (Expected: 2025.2~)
- Mobile App Programming       (Expected: 2026.12~)
- Game Programming             (Expected: 2026.12~)
- English Speaking and Writing (Expected: Some day?)

### ðŸ”­ I worked on this!
- MTG Arena Namuwiki (Private: a little embarassing to show this messy code to you... but it worked ðŸ˜„)

### ðŸ¤” I'm going to work on this!
- [kplers MTG Project](https://github.com/kplers/kplers-MTGA-Project)

This is going to be a large project indeed and will take a lot of time and learning. Currently planning to start next February.
